# 🧠 MediXpert - AI-Based Medical Diagnostic System

> **“In machine learning, nothing is truly wasted — every failed attempt teaches the model to succeed better.”**

**MediXpert** is a human-friendly, AI-powered medical diagnostic web application that assists in the **detection of brain tumors, pneumonia, and bone fractures** using deep learning models. It simplifies the diagnostic process by providing fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions from medical images.

## 📌 About the Project

MediXpert is built with the vision of supporting early-stage disease detection using Artificial Intelligence. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system processes medical scans (X-rays/MRIs) and outputs disease classification along with suggestions and model confidence.

This system was developed over several iterations of model training and tuning. The repository may contain **supporting files, model versions, experiments, or archived datasets** that were part of the development process.

## 🔬 AI & CNN-Based Architecture

Each diagnostic module is powered by a separate CNN model:

- Multiple convolutional layers extract spatial features (edges, patterns).
- Pooling layers reduce dimensionality while preserving features.
- Dropout and regularization layers improve generalization.
- Final Dense layers produce classification outputs using Softmax/Sigmoid.

The models are deployed with **Flask** to serve real-time predictions in a web-friendly interface.
